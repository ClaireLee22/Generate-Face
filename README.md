# Generate-Face
GANs Project [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree]

## Project Overview
Create a generative adversarial networks(GANs) to generate new images of faces.

First, using the MNIST dataset to test the GANs in order to see how well the model trains. Then running the GANs on the celebA dataset which is more complex.
